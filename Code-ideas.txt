DF - 	script that changes favorite foods to less specific 
		boar meat instead of boar heart, or better yet just boar
	script that automatically queues butchering orders when corpses enter corpse 			stockpile (just like tanning)
		those that can't be butchered (livestock killed by enemies) marked as Dump
	script that forbids fertilized eggs
		By species? like the auto butcher plugin expanded for eggs
		Maybe expansion of autonestbox

	script to add a "can learn" and "Butcherable only" filter option to stockpile 			screen
	script that will open "thoughts and preferences" screen from unit list (to see 			dead people prefs)

	auto mark Dump any rotten items (or non-butcherable)
	script to run all my starting scripts
